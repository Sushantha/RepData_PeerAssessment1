## Loading and preprocessing the data
  Read the data
```{r}
  Data <- read.table("activity.csv", sep= ",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
  Data$steps <- as.integer(Data$steps)
  Data$interval <- as.integer(Data$interval)
  library(plyr)
  library(ggplot2)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
    For this section, we will ignore all missing values. In order to look at total number of steps taken, first we will create a histogram of total steps taken each day
```{r}
    dailySteps <- ddply(Data, .(date), summarise, sumSteps=sum(steps))
    hist(dailySteps$sumSteps,col="red", xlab ="Total daily steps", main = "Histogram of total steps taken each day" )
```
 Next, we will take a look at the mean and median values.
```{r}
  meanSteps <-  as.integer(mean(dailySteps$sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE))
  medianSteps <- as.integer(median(dailySteps$sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE))
```
 The mean of total steps taken each day is `r meanSteps` and median of total steps taken each day is `r medianSteps`
 
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
A time series plot  of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
      avgSteps <- ddply(Data, .(interval), summarise, meanSteps=as.numeric(mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)))
      with(avgSteps, {
        plot(avgSteps$interval, avgSteps$meanSteps, type="l", pch=-1, xlab = "Time Intervals", ylab= "Average Steps per Interval", main = "Time series plot of average steps in each interval", axes=FALSE ) 
axis(side=1, at=seq(0, 2400, by=100))
axis(side=2, at=seq(0, 240, by=20))
})
   maxStep = max(avgSteps$meanSteps)
   maxInterval = avgSteps[avgSteps$meanSteps==maxStep, ]$interval
    
```
On average, the interval that contains the most number of steps is `r maxInterval `. 

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
   missingData <- Data[is.na(Data$steps), ]
   updatedData <- Data[!is.na(Data$steps), ]
   totalMissing <- nrow(missingData)
```
  The total number of rows with missing data is `r totalMissing`. 
  
  Let us replace all missing values by the average number of steps taken during the same five minute interval. We will use the average steps per interval previously calculated for this purpose as below. We will then create a new data set which is the same as the old dataset but with missing values filled in. 
  
```{r}
   index <- match(missingData$interval, avgSteps$interval) 
   missingData$steps <- avgSteps[index, ]$meanSteps
   updatedData <- rbind(updatedData, missingData)
```

For the newly computed dataset, the histogram of total steps is as shown below.
```{r}
   dailyStepsNew <- ddply(updatedData, .(date), summarise, sumSteps=sum(steps))
    hist(dailyStepsNew$sumSteps,col="red", xlab ="Total daily steps", main = "Histogram of total steps taken each day" )
```

Next, for this new dataset, we will take a look at the mean and median values.
```{r}
  meanSteps <-  as.integer(mean(dailyStepsNew$sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE))
  medianSteps <- as.integer(median(dailyStepsNew$sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE))    
```
The mean of total steps taken each day is `r meanSteps` and median of total steps taken each day is `r medianSteps`. We can thus see the mean is unchanged but median is now changed and matches the mean. 

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

We will create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day. We will then make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
```{r}
updatedData$day <- as.factor(ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(updatedData$date))  %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) 

avgSteps <- ddply(updatedData, .(day, interval), summarise, meanSteps=as.numeric(mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)))
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
g <- ggplot(avgSteps, aes( interval, meanSteps)) +geom_line() + facet_wrap(~day, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +labs(y="Number of Steps") 
  	print(g)
    
```

From the above plot, it can be seen that the number of steps taken is more on weekdays than weekends.
